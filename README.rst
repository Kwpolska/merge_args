====================================================================
merge_args — merge signatures of two functions with Advanced Hackery
====================================================================

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/Kwpolska/merge_args.svg?branch=master
   :target: https://travis-ci.org/Kwpolska/merge_args

This small library uses Advanced Python Hackery to change the signature of a
function to be a mixture of itself and a function that it wraps. It’s like
``functools.wraps``, but it allows the wrapped function to add its own
arguments into the mix.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from merge_args import merge_args

    def old(foo, bar):
        """This is old's docstring."""
        print(foo, bar)
        return foo + bar

    @merge_args(old)
    def new(prefix, foo, *args, **kwargs):
        return old(prefix + foo, *args, **kwargs)

If you then run ``help(new)``, this is the output:

.. code:: text

    Help on function new in module __main__:

    new(prefix, foo, bar)
        This is old's docstring.

How it works?
-------------

I wrote a detailed blog post, describing the ins and outs of how this package works:

This module was inspired by F4D3C0D3 on #python (formerly on freenode IRC).
